# Sp√©tris6502

A simple text based Tetris clone written in 6502 assembler for the Apple II Computer.
This is meant to be just a little fun learning project to teach myself 6502 assembler for a computer of my childhood.

Largely based on this excellent tutorial from Javidx9 on how to write a text mode Tetris clone in C++ for Windows:
